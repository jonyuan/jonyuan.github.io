  	<h2>Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA)</h2>
  	<p>On campus I spend most of my time working with the TASA board to host cool campus-wide events, including the annual Spring Lantern Festival, speaker event (we have previously featured Anna Akana, The Jubilee Project, Steven Lim, and Elephante), seasonal Food Workshops, and (for the first time this year) a Taiwanese Night Market.</p>
  	<p>Most notably for me was winning the William J. Michel RSO of the Year Award in May 2019. We work hard to host fun and inclusive cultural events for everyone on campus, and I am excited for what's to come for the club in the coming years. </p>
  	<p>I am currently working on developing the organization's website.</p>
